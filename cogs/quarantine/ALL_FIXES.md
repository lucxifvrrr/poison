# All Fixes - Quarantine System

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. User ID Muting Issue ✅

**Problem:**
- When trying to mute/unmute users with their user IDs, the bot would mute them but show an error message saying they weren't muted
- Example: `!qmute 123456789012345678 spam` would fail

**Root Cause:**
- The command was using `discord.Member` type hint which relies on Discord.py's automatic converter
- The converter wasn't properly handling raw user IDs in all cases

**Solution:**
- Changed parameter type from `discord.Member` to `str`
- Added custom member resolution logic that:
  1. First tries Discord.py's `MemberConverter` (handles mentions, names, nicknames)
  2. If that fails, tries to parse as user ID and fetch the member
  3. Strips mention formatting (`<@!123>` → `123`)

**Now Works With:**
- ✅ Mentions: `!qmute @username spam`
- ✅ User IDs: `!qmute 123456789012345678 spam`
- ✅ Usernames: `!qmute username spam`
- ✅ Nicknames: `!qmute nickname spam`

### 2. Custom Emojis in Embed Footers ✅

**Problem:**
- Custom Discord emojis (like `<:alert:1426440385269338164>`) don't render in embed footers
- They show as raw text which looks unprofessional

**Solution:**
- Replaced all custom emojis in `set_footer()` calls with Unicode emojis

**Changes:**
- `<:ogs_info:...>` → `✉️` (envelope)
- `<:alert:...>` → `⚠️` (warning)
- `<a:white_tick:...>` → `✅` (check mark)

### 3. Role Hierarchy Check Too Strict ✅

**Problem:**
- Administrators were getting blocked from muting members with high roles
- Error: `<:alert:1426440385269338164> You cannot act on a member with an equal or higher top role`
- This happened even when the admin had Administrator permission

**Root Cause:**
- The `_actor_can_target()` method was checking role hierarchy for ALL users
- It didn't have a special case for administrators
- Discord's permission system allows administrators to bypass role hierarchy

**Solution:**
- Added administrator bypass to the hierarchy check
- Now checks in this order:
  1. ✅ **Server owner** can target anyone
  2. ❌ **Nobody** can target the server owner
  3. ✅ **Administrators** can target anyone (except owner)
  4. ⚠️ **Non-admins** must have higher role than target

**Code Changes:**
```python
# Before
def _actor_can_target(self, guild, actor, target):
    if actor.id == guild.owner_id:
        return True, None
    if target.id == guild.owner_id:
        return False, "Cannot moderate the server owner."
    if target.top_role >= actor.top_role:
        return False, "You cannot act on a member with an equal or higher top role."
    return True, None

# After
def _actor_can_target(self, guild, actor, target):
    # Server owner can target anyone
    if actor.id == guild.owner_id:
        return True, None
    
    # Cannot target server owner
    if target.id == guild.owner_id:
        return False, "Cannot moderate the server owner."
    
    # Administrators can target anyone except owner
    if actor.guild_permissions.administrator:
        return True, None
    
    # For non-admins, check role hierarchy
    if target.top_role >= actor.top_role:
        return False, "You cannot act on a member with an equal or higher top role."
    
    return True, None
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Administrators can now mute anyone (except server owner)
- ✅ Moderators still have role hierarchy restrictions for safety
- ✅ Server owner has full control
- ✅ Nobody can mute the server owner

## 📝 Testing

### Test User ID Muting
```bash
# Test with user ID
!qmute 123456789012345678 spam

# Test with mention
!qmute @username spam

# Test unmute with ID
!qunmute 123456789012345678
```

### Test Administrator Bypass
```bash
# As an administrator, try to mute someone with a high role
!qmute @HighRoleMember spam

# Should work now without hierarchy error
```

### Verify Footer Emojis
1. Mute a user and check the log embed footer
2. Should see: `✉️ User notified via DM` (not raw emoji code)
3. Unmute a user and check the log embed footer
4. Should see: `✅ Mute successfully removed` (not raw emoji code)

---

## ✅ Summary

All three issues have been resolved:

1. **User ID Muting** - Works with IDs, mentions, usernames, and nicknames
2. **Footer Emojis** - Clean Unicode emojis that render properly
3. **Role Hierarchy** - Administrators can now mute anyone except server owner

The quarantine system is now more robust and user-friendly! 🎉

## 🎯 Permission Hierarchy

After these fixes, here's how permissions work:

| User Type | Can Mute Who? |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Server Owner** | Everyone except themselves |
| **Administrator** | Everyone except owner and themselves |
| **Moderator (with mod role)** | Only members with lower roles |
| **Regular User** | Nobody |

This matches Discord's standard permission model! ✅
