# Fixes Applied to Counting System

## Date: Oct 16, 2025

### 1. ✅ Removed Terminal Logs - All Logs Now in bot.log

**Files Modified:** `cogs/counting/counting.py`

- Added `import logging` to imports
- Replaced all `print()` statements with proper logging:
  - `logging.info()` for informational messages
  - `logging.warning()` for warnings
  - `logging.error()` for errors
- All counting logs now appear in `logs/bot.log` with timestamps

### 2. ✅ Fixed MongoDB Connection Issues

**Problem:** Multiple cogs were creating separate MongoDB connections, causing:
- Connection pool exhaustion
- SSL handshake timeouts
- "MongoClient background task encountered an error" messages

**Solution:**

**Files Modified:** 
- `main.py` - Added shared MongoDB connection
- `cogs/counting/counting.py` - Updated to reuse shared connection

**Changes:**
1. Created a single shared `AsyncIOMotorClient` in `main.py` bot initialization
2. Updated counting.py to reuse `bot.mongo_client` if available
3. Only creates new connection if shared one doesn't exist
4. Tracks connection ownership to prevent premature closure
5. Properly closes connection only when bot shuts down

**Configuration:**
```python
maxPoolSize=50      # Maximum connections
minPoolSize=5       # Pre-allocated connections (reduced from 10)
connectTimeoutMS=10000
socketTimeoutMS=45000
```

### 3. ✅ Fixed Embed Auto-Deletion Issues

**Files Modified:** `cogs/counting/counting.py`

**Changes:**
1. **Line 679:** Removed auto-deletion of "broke counting" embed - now persists permanently
2. **Line 663:** Removed auto-deletion of "same user twice" warning embed - now persists permanently

Both warning embeds now remain visible in the channel instead of disappearing after 2 seconds.

### 4. ✅ Standardized Embed Colors

**Files Modified:** `cogs/counting/counting.py`

All embeds now use consistent color `#2f3136` (EMBED_COLOR):
- Banned user DM embed
- "Can't count twice in a row" warning
- "Broke the counting" message

### Benefits of These Fixes

1. **Performance:** Single MongoDB connection reduces overhead and prevents timeouts
2. **Reliability:** No more SSL handshake errors or connection pool exhaustion
3. **Maintainability:** Centralized logging in bot.log for easier debugging
4. **User Experience:** Warning embeds persist for better visibility
5. **Consistency:** All embeds use the same color scheme

### Testing Recommendations

1. Restart the bot and verify:
   - Only one "MongoDB connection initialized" message appears
   - No SSL handshake timeout errors
   - All counting logs appear in `logs/bot.log`
   - Warning embeds don't auto-delete

2. Test counting functionality:
   - Count correctly (should get reaction)
   - Count twice in a row (warning should persist)
   - Break counting with wrong number (message should persist)

### Future Improvements

Consider updating other cogs to use the shared MongoDB connection:
- `cogs/afk_cog.py`
- `cogs/vc-roles.py`
- `cogs/media.py`
- `cogs/confess.py`
- `cogs/reqrole.py`
- `cogs/sticky.py`

This will further reduce connection overhead and improve performance.
